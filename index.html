        My name is <b>Adesanya Abigail</b>.
        Once, I noticed a swelling on my neck.
        I was perplexed and afraid until I got to know online that it was a <i>lymph node</i>
        and was as a result of infection and that really calmed me.
        Then, I decided to help provide solution to human needs through this medium.
        Since then, <b>iâ€™ve fallen in love</b> <i>with tech after I got to know of how it provide
        solutione</i> to numerous human needs and also gives answers to questions.
        Hence, it is a good platform to expressing who I want to be.
        <b>A problem solver!</b>
        </p>

        <p style="color:red; font-size: 14px;">
            My training with <b>STUTERN</b> has been amazing!
            So far,i've learnt how to use <i>GIT AND GITHUB</i>professionally,how to find my way around <i>HTML</i>and <i>CSS.</i>
        </p>
            <p style="color:red; font-size: 14px;">
                CSS makes the front-end of a website shine and it creates a great user experience.
                Without CSS, websites would be less pleasing to the eye and likely much harder to navigate.
                Also,CSS is responsible for font color and more.

    <b>Padding creates extra space within an element.</b>
    An element's padding area is the space between its content and its border.

</p>
<p style="color:blue; font-size: 14px;">
<b>Margins are used to create space around elements,<i>outside of any defined borders.</i></b>
</p>

<p style="color:blue; font-size: 14px;">
    <b>The border property sets an element's border.</b>
    <i>It sets the values of border-width , border-style , and border-color.</i> 
</p>
<p style="color:blue; font-size: 14px;">
    Hence, the difference betweeen padding,margins and border is that while all have something in common which is that they
    are all responsiblefor space creation, padding is responsible for creating
     space within an element while border sets borders to an element as the name implies  while margin is
     responsible for creating space around an element.
